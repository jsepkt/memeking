        <h1>MEMEKING - Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: October 26, 2023</em> <!-- ACTION: REPLACE WITH CURRENT DATE --> </p>

        <p>Welcome to MEMEKING! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the MEMEKING website and AI meme generation service (collectively, the "Service") operated by Pillow Gold Developers LLC ("us", "we", or "our"). Please read these Terms carefully before using our Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
        <p>MEMEKING allows you to generate memes based on text prompts you provide. You are granted a license to use the Service for personal, non-commercial entertainment purposes, subject to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>3. User Conduct and Content Responsibility</h2>
        <p>You are solely responsible for the text prompts you submit and the images ("User-Generated Content") created as a result. You agree not to use the Service to create, display, or share content that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is unlawful, illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable;</li>
            <li>Depicts or promotes graphic violence, self-harm, or explicit sexual content (18+ material);</li>
            <li>Infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party;</li>
            <li>Contains software viruses or any other computer code, files, or programs designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment;</li>
            <li>Constitutes unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, "junk mail," "spam," "chain letters," "pyramid schemes," or any other form of solicitation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We employ filtering mechanisms to prevent the generation of prohibited content. However, these filters may not be exhaustive or foolproof. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to review prompts and/or block the generation of or remove User-Generated Content that we determine, in our sole discretion, violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable, without prior notice.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that MEMEKING and Pillow Gold Developers LLC are not responsible for the content created by users or the AI, nor for any misuse of such User-Generated Content. The ultimate responsibility for all User-Generated Content and its consequences lies solely with the user who originated such content.</p>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Service and its original content (excluding User-Generated Content), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Pillow Gold Developers LLC and its licensors. You retain whatever ownership rights you have in the prompts you submit. Images generated are novel works; your ability to use, share, or copyright such images may be subject to the terms of the underlying AI models and applicable law.</p>

        <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance.</p>
        <p>Pillow Gold Developers LLC does not warrant that a) the Service will function uninterrupted, secure, or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements or expectations.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall Pillow Gold Developers LLC, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

        <h2>7. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

        <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your State/Country, e.g., Florida, United States], without regard to its conflict of law provisions. <!-- ACTION: REPLACE WITH YOUR JURISDICTION --></p>
