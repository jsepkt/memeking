        <p>Pillow Gold Developers LLC ("us", "we", or "our") operates the MEMEKING website and service (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>
        <h3>Types of Data Collected:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Data & Prompts:</strong> When you use the Service to generate a meme, we collect the text prompt you provide. We may also collect information on how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. Submitted prompts are sent to a third-party AI service (Hugging Face or similar) to generate images.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
        <p>Pillow Gold Developers LLC uses the collected data for various purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and maintain our Service</li>
            <li>To monitor the usage of our Service</li>
            <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues</li>
            <li>To monitor for and prevent abuse of the Service, including the generation of prohibited content</li>
            <li>To improve our Service and filtering mechanisms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Transfer Of Data / Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Your information, including submitted prompts, will be processed by third-party AI image generation services (such as those available via Hugging Face) to create the memes. These services have their own privacy policies and terms. We are not responsible for the data handling practices of these third-party services.</p>
        <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those from your jurisdiction.</p>

            <li>To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
            <li>To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public</li>
            <li>To protect against legal liability</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Security of Data</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

        <h2>7. Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us (e.g., Pump.fun, X, Telegram). If you click a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
